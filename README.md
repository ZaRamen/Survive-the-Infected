# Survive-the-Infected
A shoot em up type of game that is based off the game boxhead with the libgdx framework

Extra Tutorial tips that I forgot to put in the game:

- Lvl 2 - unlock MachineGun
- Lvl 3 - unlock RocketLauncher
- Lvl 4 - unlock Raygun
- Note for all of these you get them in the first lootbox for that level 
- (if you pass that level without picking up a lootbox you miss the opportunity to get it again) (slight bug)

- Use the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 to switch weapons
- The game is endless and Press P to pause the game

- Made for my marking period 4 project for my csa class during the months of May - June 2022
- Was made with a lot of help from stackoverlow, game dev exchange and not the cleanest of code.
